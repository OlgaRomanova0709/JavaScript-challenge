# JavaScript Challenge - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background
![images/nasa.jpg](UFO-level-2/static/images/nasa.jpg)
The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually.
We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](UFO-level-2/static/js/data.js). We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though...
 ## We use
 <b> JavaScript </b>
 <b> HTML </b>
 <b> CSS </b>
 <b> D3.js </b>

## Creating a basic HTML web page 

### Level 1:
* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects,  we wrote code that appends a table to our web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting (columns `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`).

* Made a search through the `date/time` column .

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

Level 1 + additional search

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
